## ðŸ“ˆ Results Analysis

### 1. Error Rates

* **HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests):** 52,277 occurrences
* **Connection Reset (Error 10054):** 1,122 occurrences

These errors indicate that the server's rate-limiting mechanisms were triggered, likely due to the high volume of requests.

### 2. Response Times

* **Median Response Time (p50):** 480 ms
* **Average Response Time:** 1,430.6 ms
* **95th Percentile Response Time (p95):** 55,003 ms
* **99th Percentile Response Time (p99):** 46,183 ms

The significant increase in response times, especially at higher percentiles, suggests that the server struggled to handle the load, leading to delays in processing requests.

### 3. Request Statistics

* **Total Requests:** 92,908
* **Successful Requests:** 53,999
* **Failure Rate:** 42.1%

The high failure rate underscores the server's inability to manage the traffic effectively, resulting in a substantial number of failed requests.
